# Learn JavaScript 🚀

Welcome to the **Learn JavaScript** repository!  
This repo is designed to help beginners and intermediate learners understand JavaScript through structured examples and small projects.  

---

## 📂 Repository Structure
- Each folder contains a specific **JavaScript concept** (e.g., Variables, Loops, Functions, etc.).
- Inside every folder:
  - `index.html` → contains definitions and explanation notes.  
  - `index.js` / `script.js` → contains the working JavaScript code.  

---

## 🎯 Mini Projects
Along with basics, you’ll also find **mini-projects** (like a Number Guessing Game) to practice JavaScript concepts in a fun and practical way.  

---

## 📚 Learning in Progress
I am currently exploring **Advanced JavaScript**, and new folders will be added here as I learn.
