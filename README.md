# Learn JavaScript 🚀 

Welcome to the **Learn JavaScript** repository!  
This repo is designed to help beginners and intermediate learners understand JavaScript through structured examples and small projects.

## 📂 Repository Structure
- Each folder contains a specific **JavaScript concept** (e.g., Variables, Loops, Functions, etc.).
- Inside every folder:
  - `index.html` → contains definitions and explanation notes.  
  - `index.js` / `script.js` → contains the working JavaScript code.

## 🛠 Mini Projects
Along with examples, you’ll also find **small projects** to practice:
- Number Guessing Game   
- Counter Program ⏱  
- And more coming soon...
